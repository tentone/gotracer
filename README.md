# GoTracer
 - Software Raytracer written in golang.
 - Images can be previewed directly on the window as they are rendered.
 - Interaction can be done using keys from the keyboard, to control the camera.

## Performance

 - To improve performance multi-threading was added to the renderer.
 - Data had to be reordered for go to actually scale properly with multiple threads.
 - Calling multiple goroutines that use that same data cause them to lock on each other to access data and the performance gains are minimal.
 - Tests were performed with 154 objects in the render scene.
 - Tests performed on a Core i5 6500 (4 Core) with DDR3 memory w/ 4 threads.
 - Tested base performance number for a single thread.
 - Tested splitting the work by multiple goroutines each routine processes one portion of the output.
 - Tested explicit object copies for each thread was able to reduce time further by skipping the synchronization points added by the go race condition detector.

 - Performed new tests on new Go 1.12.8, also tested the go:norace flag, will have to repeat on a CPU with more cores.
 - Using the //go:norace code annotation to skip the data race condition analysis.
 - Test platform was a Core i7 3537u (2 Core HT) running Go 1.12.8 w/ 4 threads, in the CPU it was easy to double the performance without the implicit sync points being a problem.
